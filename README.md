# Smart-Bin
A line following smart dustbin made as part of Tathva: NIT Calicut's technical fest.

It has the following functionality:

1. It follows a black line anywhere in a room using 2 infrared sensors on the front to detect any deviation from the line and according align itself as instructed in the code.

2. The lid opens on its own by waving our hand above it. This is done using a proximity sensor that detects how far away an object is from the lid and accordingly open the lid when its close enough. The action of opening is done by a motor.

3. The opening of the lid and the destination of the dustbin may also be controlled via bluetooth using a mobile application
